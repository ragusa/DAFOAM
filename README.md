# DAFOAM: Data Assimilation in OpenFOAM

DAFOAM is an open research repository dedicated to advancing data assimilation and state reconstruction techniques for high-fidelity multiphysics simulations using OpenFOAM. By integrating optimal sensor placement strategies, we bridge the gap between detailed full-order models and real-world applications. We welcome contributions from researchers and practitioners eager to innovate in computational modeling and sensor-based state estimation.
