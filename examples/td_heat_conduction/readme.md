This directory contains case sets for transient heat conduction simulations, along with illustrative examples of various Data Assimilation (DA) algorithms applied to these cases. The cases are structured as follows:

- **[uniformDT-plate](./uniformDT-plate)**: This case set involves an OpenFOAM simulation of a heat plate characterized by a uniform thermal diffusivity (DT) throughout its entire domain. 

- **[triZone-plate](./triZone-plate)**: This case set represents an OpenFOAM simulation of a heat plate segmented into three distinct zones, each assigned a unique but uniform thermal diffusivity (DT). 

- **[triZone-oneDynamicDT-plate](./triZone-plate)**: This case set details an OpenFOAM simulation of a heat plate divided into three zones, where two zones maintain uniform thermal diffusivity (DT), while the third exhibits a time-dependent DT.
