Under the `examples` folders, OpenFOAM cases data (and sometimes their generated solution snapshots) can be found.

The contents in each subfolders is as follows:

- **[td_heat_conduction](./td_heat_conduction)**  contains the case sets for the different variations of the time dependent heat conduction. 

- **[td_2D_MSFR](./td_2D_MSFR)** contains the case sets for the different variations of the 2D MSFR. 

- **[td_1D_MSR](./td_1D_MSR)** contains the case sets for the different variations of 1D MSR.
