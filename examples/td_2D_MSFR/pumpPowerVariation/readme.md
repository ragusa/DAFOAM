The simulation can be run on a single processor by running *[Allrun](./Allrun)* from the terminal as

```bash
./Allrun
```
The simulation can be run in parallel by running *[Allrun-parallel](./Allrun-parallel)* from the terminal as follows:

```bash
./Allrun-parallel <Nprocessor>
```
If `<Nprocessor>` is not provided, the script will use all the processors in the systemâ€” that is, the number of processor equal to the value returned by the `nproc` command.

New `data.csv` file can be generated by running *[momentum_value_gen.py](./Data/momentum_value_gen.py)* from the terminal as follows:
```bash
python3 ./Data/momentum_value_gen.py <start_value> <end_value> <total_count>
```
It should be noted that the value generated will be random.
